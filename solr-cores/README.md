Still experimental code and config files for storing stuff from pinboard.in
(bookmarks, notes and Twitter data exported as JSON files) in Solr. If you are
already familiar with Solr you shouldn't have too much trouble getting things
set up.

It doesn't really do anything yet and I'm not really sure what it _will_ do but
there are tools for importing the JSON exports from pinboard. (20121223/straup)
